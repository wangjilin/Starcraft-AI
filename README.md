# Starcraft-AI
Keras based CNN model training the computer to play Starcraft on its own

Hi!

As AlphaStar from Google Deepmind is very powerful today, I am also very interested in how to train a AI model to play Starcraft.

In this project, instead of using Reinforcement learning, I using a simple CNN model on the visualized position of exsisting buildings and units to decide what is the next step.

Best score to defeat hard computer... Still a long way to beat a real human...
